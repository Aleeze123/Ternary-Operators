Ternary Operator in TypeScript/Javascript
Overview
This repository explores the ternary operator in TypeScript and Javascript, highlighting 
its usage and benefits in simplifying conditional statements.

What is the Ternary Operator?
The ternary operator (condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse) provides a shorthand way to write conditional statements.
It evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions depending on whether the condition is true or false.

Benefits

Conciseness: Reduces the verbosity of if...else statements.
Readability: Enhances code clarity by expressing conditions in a compact form.
Efficiency: Improves efficiency by minimizing the number of lines needed for conditional assignments.
Best Practices
Use ternary operators for simple, straightforward conditions to maintain readability.
Avoid nesting ternary operators excessively to ensure code remains understandable.
